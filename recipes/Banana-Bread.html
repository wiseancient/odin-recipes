    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Moist Banana Bread with Raisins Recipe is true to its name; it will give you moist and yummy banana bread with a few easy steps. I love to eat cold banana bread, so I had this chilled inside the fridge for at least 2 hours and had it with a cup of black coffee…</p>
    <p>This moist banana bread recipe is simple. However, it is important that you pay extra attention to the state and amount of banana that you will use. Overripe bananas are best, as far as I am concerned. It is also recommended to use 2 extra large bananas, or 3 medium sized bananas to attain the best possible result.
        You can use a Pyrex loaf pan (like what I did), or any regular aluminum or metal loaf pan that you have available when baking the banana bread– it does not matter. However, since not all ovens work the same, I suggest that you check if your moist banana bread with raisins is done within 45 minutes of baking using the toothpick test. Simply stick a piece of toothpick into your banana bread and pull it out completely. If it comes out clean, 
        then you can remove the bread from the oven. Otherwise, continue to bake until the bread is completely done.</p>
